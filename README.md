# Quantum Pacman 

This is an online game of the classic game of Pacman but with a quantum twist!

## Quantum Features
Welcome to the classic arcade game Pacman but with a quantum physics twist!H ere’s how to play:
<br> Use the WASD or the arrow keys on your keyboard if you are on PC
<br> Gobble and swallow pellets to gain points.
<br> Careful! The ghosts (inky, blinky, pinky, and clyde) exist to hunt you down. But in this game, they act as quantum particles!
<br> What does this mean? It means the position of all ghosts is not deterministic but instead given as probability distribution. Effectively, this makes all ghosts invisible, and there is little certainty in their position at any given time.
<br> Wait! When Pacman eats a certain number of pellets, he will ‘flash’ himself around a certain radius, making the area around him visible where all ghosts caught inside will ‘collapse’ to their true positions. 
<br> When Pacman consumes a power-pellet, he will flash the entire board, forcing all ghosts to collapse to their positions and making them vulnerable to consume so that their flesh are quantified into points.


## Features

Varius types of friuts
<br>1st round: cherry, etc.
<br>Blinky (red ghost) gets mad when you are almost done eating all of the pellets
<br>(means he will chase you)
<br>Nice animation
<br>Pause and mute function

<br>Starts with three lives
<br>Gains extra life when gained enough points
