# Quantum Pacman ![Pacman](/app/style/graphics/spriteSheets/characters/pacman/pacman_right.svg) ⚛️ ![Blinky](/app/style/graphics/spriteSheets/characters/ghosts/blinky/blinky_left_angry.svg)

The classic game of Pacman but with a quantum twist!

## Game Rules
- Gobble and swallow pellets to gain points.
- Careful! The ghosts (inky, blinky, pinky, and clyde) exist to hunt you down. But in this game, they act as quantum particles!
- What does this mean? It means the position of all ghosts is not deterministic but instead given as probability distribution. Effectively, this makes all ghosts invisible, and there is little certainty in their position at any given time.
- Wait! When Pacman eats a certain number of pellets, he will ‘flash’ himself around a certain radius, making the area around him visible where all ghosts caught inside will ‘collapse’ to their true positions. 
- When Pacman consumes a power-pellet, he will flash the entire board, forcing all ghosts to collapse to their positions and making them vulnerable to consume so that their flesh are quantified into points.

## Quantum Features
Each ghost acts as quantum particles whose position is given by a probability distribution.​

When a ghost falls within the radius of Pac-Man's flash, they collapse to a position!
